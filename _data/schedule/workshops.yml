        title: Containarized Development using Docker
        speaker: sanchit_balchandani
        description: >
          <p>Modern-day development has to be fast-paced. Docker and Container toolset helps
          us achieve this up to a certain extent. Especially when working in a large team
          environment and with too many microservices, it becomes very difficult to manage
          apps and there CI/CD, setup steps, etc. With Docker and Containers, we can solve
          the above-mentioned problem set.</p>

          <p>In this Workshop, attendees will get an intermediate level of introduction to
          Docker and Docker Compose with the help of some real-time use cases and demos.
          Sanchit will demonstrate and explain how Docker makes the developer more
          efficient. This would be a one and half hour workshop so we'd avoid discussing
          the very basics of Containers, Virtual Machines of Microservice, though we'll
          focus on to understand how to approach containerizing an application.</p>

        title: Unit Testing with Mocks
        speaker: Vijay Kumar
        description: >
          <p>The workshop is aimed at people who are familiar with Python basics, and would
          like to improve their skills, by learning how to write professional quality
          Python code.</p>

          <p>Modifying Python code without unit test cases is like walking through a field
          of landmines. Python's dynamic nature allows typos in variable / attribute names,
          and incorrect indentation to go unnoticed, until a specific input drives it
          through the erroneous code path. Integration testing be it manual or automated
          is insufficient and can at times be frustrating for Python code.</p>

          <p>Fortunately Python's ecosystem has a plethora of libraries that makes it easy
          to write unit test cases, by providing the needed infrastructure. Through this
          workshop we will show how to use the py.test framework for writing test cases.
          We will cover how dependencies can be isolated using mocking and patching.</p>

          <p><b>Brief Agenda</b><br/>
          Introduction to Unit Testing<br/>
          Getting Started with py.test Unit Testing Framework<br/>
          Mocking and Patching<br/></p>

          <p><b>Prerequisites</b><br/>
          Familiarity with basic Object Oriented Programming with Python<br/>
          <b>Software Requirements</b> - Python 3, py.test, pygame<br/></p>

        title: Decrypting ML models using LIME
        speaker: laisha_wadhwa
        description: >
          <p>With wide no. of libraries & frameworks available for building ML models, ML has
          become a black-box these days. Thus model interpretability is vital. But its hard
          to define a model's decision boundary in simple terms. With LIME its easy to produce
          faithful explanations and decrypt any ML model.</p>

          <b>Brief Agenda</b><br/>
          <p>The workshop will be primarily highlighting the necessity of understanding the
          outputs of ML models to build a profound understanding of how ML works.</p>

          <p>At the end of the workshop you’ll know how to explain your model to possible anyone!
          This makes it easier for you to sell your Business idea.</p>

          <p>In order to create trust in our model, we need to explain the model not only to
          ML experts but also to domain experts which require a human understandable
          explanation. You’ll be equipped in creating a model agnostic locally faithful
          explanation set which helps even the non experts in understanding how the original
          model is making it’s decision.</p>

          <p>All this sounds exciting, to add to this, a demonstration on the classic TITANIC
          data-set will be given to build a profound understanding of the concepts discussed.</p>
